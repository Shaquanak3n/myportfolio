					<h3>About Me:</h3>
					<p>Hi! I am Shaquana Kenyon, I am 19 years old,  born <time datetime="2005-09-04">September 4th, 2005</time>. My favourite colours are purple(any shade), blue, and yellow. My mother, Ayata Blake Cole, and father, Canute Kenyon, are my biggest supporters.</p>
					<p>
						I attended Free Hill Primary School, located in St. Mary, and later moved on to St. Hilda's Diocesan High School for first and second form.
						For third to lower sixth, I attended <i><b>The Manning's School</b></i>, which I consider to be the <b>BEST</b> high school in the world. I spent some of the most 
						amazing years of my life there, surrounded by incredible teachers and the greatest friends I've ever met. 
					</p>	
					<p>	Along with these amazing teachers and friends, I had the pleasure of joining some wonderful clubs, including:
						<ul>
						<li>&nbsp;Debate Society</li>
						<li>&nbsp;Interact Club</li>
						<li>&nbsp;Mathematics Club</li>
						<li>&nbsp;Girls' Guide</li>
						and more.
						</ul>
						After these incredible years, I graduated in 2022 (see gallery for graduation picture) and returned to sixth form for only the first year. 
					</p>	
					<p>In 2023, I applied to the University of Technology and was accepted! Even better, I received a scholarship. Unfortunately, I have only been able to go on one excursion this past year.
						I hiked Blue Mountain (see gallery for pictures), which was tiring but fun. We got lost for an hour or so, but we made it to the cabins safe and sound! The following morning, 
						when the group was going to the peak, I unfortunately slept in and missed it. So that was a little disappointing!
					</p>
					<p>	Now, I'm in second year. I'm loving some of my modules, but finding others more challenging. However, I'm not giving up! I hope this year will be as fun, if not more, than last year.</p>
					<p>Thank you for reading! Remember to check out the gallery for pictures and videos!</p>
