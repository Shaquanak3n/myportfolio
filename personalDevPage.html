			<h3><b>My Reflection on <q>Twelve Pillars</q> by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</b></h3>
			<p>
			These chapters outline key principles that resonate with my current goals and mindset, offering actionable strategies I can apply to my life.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<i><b>Achieving Goals</b></i> is something I’ve always valued, but this chapter reframed how I think about setting them. Often, I set broad goals, 
				like <i>get better at programming</i>, but this chapter stresses the need for specificity. To apply this, I will set clear, measurable milestones—such 
				as completing specific projects or mastering particular coding languages. By breaking down large goals into smaller tasks, I can make my progress 
				more tangible and maintain motivation.
			</p>
				The <i><b>Proper Use of Time</b></i> is a particularly relevant lesson. I've noticed I sometimes spend too much time on activities that do not bring me closer to my goals. 
				For example, I find myself getting absorbed in TikTok videos when I could be enhancing my skills and acquiring knowledge of programming languages essential for reaching 
				my career aspirations. To improve my time management, I’ll prioritize tasks that have the most impact on my goals. Using tools like time-blocking to help me focus on 
				high-value tasks and reduce time wasted on distractions.
			<p>
				<i><b>Surrounding Myself with the Best People</b></i> is something I’ve intuitively understood but haven’t always prioritized. I need to surround myself with individuals who 
				motivate me to improve, particularly in my studies and future professional endeavours. By networking with individuals who share my ambitions or have achieved success 
				in areas I aspire to, I can benefit from their insights and motivation. This chapter has reinforced the idea that being intentional about relationships can accelerate my growth.
			</p>
				Finally, <i><b>Being a Life-Long Learner</b></i> resonates with my aspiration to constantly enhance my programming skills and other areas of expertise.  I already enjoy learning, but this 
				chapter pushes me to be more proactive. I plan to start reading some of the books on Mr. Davis’ list, beginning with <a href="../Assets/pdfcoffee.com_the-magic-of-thinking-big-david-j-schwartz-pdf-free.pdf" target="_blank">The Magic of Thinking Big</a>. This chapter’s reminder that 
				learning extends beyond formal education encourages me to seek knowledge in everyday experiences and interactions.
			<p>
			
			</p>
				Chapters 4-7 of <q><i><b><a href="../Assets/pdfcoffee.com_twelve-pillars-pdf-free.pdf" target="_blank">Twelve Pillars</b></i></q></a> provide a powerful framework for personal growth and success. By setting clear goals, managing time effectively, surrounding myself with the right people, 
				and committing to lifelong learning, I can align my actions with my ambitions. These lessons are not only inspiring but also practical, giving me specific steps to take toward a more focused, successful future.
