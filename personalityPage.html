			<section class="info" style="text-align:center"> <h3><i>My Strongest Trait</i></h3>
				
				<p>	My strongest trait is that I am determined. Once I put my mind to something, I always ensure I get it done exactly as I imagined. Regardless of how challenging
					or frustrating the journey is, I am willing to take that journey a thousand times if needed. This trait is especially helpful in my Mathematics and Programming 
					courses, where research and consistent practice are essential.
				</p>	
				<p>
					An example of this determination in action is when I missed nearly three weeks of school classes due to illness. During that time, two new topics 
					were introduced in College Mathematics which I did not learn/understand. Despite being behind, I practiced every chance I got and pulled many 
					late-night study sessions to catch up. At the same time, I had Programming 2 assignments to complete and submit. Despite the heavy workload, 
					I managed to pass both courses with an A+ and an A-, respectively, proving that my determination helped me succeed even in tough situations. 
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3><i>My Strongest Emotion</i></h3>
				
				<p>	
					The most prominent emotion I experience is fear. I am often fearful of failing, giving presentations, and talking out of turn or trying to be funny
					in conversations. This fear has affected me in several ways, particularly when it comes to presentations. My anxiety has caused me to mess up during presentations, 
					resulting in lower grades for that aspect of my courses. Fear also hinders my ability to fully participate in group discussions, as I’m constantly worried about 
					saying the wrong thing and embarrassing myself. 
				</p>	
				<p>	
					This fear even extends to asking teachers for help, as I often worry that my questions will seem foolish or that I should just look for the answer online. 
					However, while fear holds me back in these areas, it also motivates me. My fear of failing pushes me to complete my work on time and to the best of my ability. 
					It drives me to ensure that, even if I don’t achieve the highest grade, I know that I gave it my all and that my effort was not the cause of my shortcoming.

					<p>
						<q>If you want to be truly happy in life, surround yourself with people who make you laugh. And also, people who bring snacks.</q>― Phil dunphy&#128513
					</p>
					<p>
						One of my favorite quotes is from Phil Dunphy, a character from <i>Modern Family</i>. Phil embodies a happy-go-lucky attitude that I deeply admire. 
						Despite often being oblivious to what's happening around him, he maintains a constant smile and an upbeat outlook. Even in difficult situations, 
						he manages to find the silver lining and stays positive. Phil is also not afraid to strike up conversations with random people, even if the interaction 
						is a little awkward. He always cracks jokes and perform magic tricks in front of rooms full of people, and even if no one else laughs or finds it funny, he still smiles and laughs at himself. 
						What I find inspiring is that he doesn’t let these moments discourage him. Phil’s ability to remain optimistic, and confident, regardless of the circumstances, influences how 
						I strive to handle challenges and awkward interactions in my own life.

						<h3><i>Was the Test Accurate?</i></h3>
						<p>I believe this test is quite accurate. Others have mentioned that it reflects who they truly are, and I feel the same way. 
						   However, while I agree with most of the results, I don’t think the part about my emotional availability is entirely accurate. 
						   The suggestion that I might struggle to express emotions or understand others’ emotional needs doesn't reflect how I handle my connections. 
						   Not only am I committed and reliable, but I also express my feelings openly and make a conscious effort to listen and understand the emotions of others. 
						   I am mindful of emotional intimacy and respond to the needs of those around me, which fosters stronger intimate connections.
						</P>
